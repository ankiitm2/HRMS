# HRMS Lite – Full Stack Assignment

## Project Overview
HRMS Lite is a lightweight Human Resource Management System designed to manage basic HR operations.  
The application allows an admin to manage employee records and track daily attendance through a clean, professional, and production-ready web interface.

The system is built with a clear separation between frontend and backend, using RESTful APIs and persistent storage, and is deployed on cloud platforms for real-world usability.
